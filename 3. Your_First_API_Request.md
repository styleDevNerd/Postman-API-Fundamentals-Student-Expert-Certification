## Task : Create a collection

Collections are used in Postman to organize API requests.

1. **Create a New Collection:**
    - Open Postman and navigate to the left pane.
    - Click the plus ("+") icon or select "Create a collection."

## Task : Get books from the Library API

### Making the First Request

1. Create a new request within your Collection by clicking "Add a request" or via the three dots icon.

2. Name the request "get books", set the request method to GET, and the request URL to `https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books`.
    - Be sure to hit Save your work using `Ctrl + s` or `Cmd + s`;

3. Send the request by clicking the "Send" button.

![]()

### Viewing the Response

Once the request is sent, the server will respond with a JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) body containing an array of book objects.

### Request Methods

HTTP request methods, also known as HTTP verbs, dictate the type of operation to perform.

| Method Name | Operation |
| ----------- | --------- |
| GET | Retrieve data (Read) |
| POST | Send data (Create) |
| PUT/PATCH | Update data (Update) * PUT usually replaces an entire resource, whereas PATCH usually is for partial updates |
| DELETE | Delete data (Delete) |

The choice of method depends on the intended operation and API documentation.

### Request URL

A request URL consists of a protocol, host, and path, pointing to a specific resource on the server.

| Protocol | Host | Path |
| -------- | ---- | ---- |
| `https://` | `library-api.postmanlabs.com` | `/books` |
| `http://` or `https://` | location of the server | route on the server |

Paths and complete URLs are also sometimes called **API endpoints**.

### Response Status Codes

Response status codes indicate the success or failure of a request.

| Code range | Meaning | Examples |
| ---------- | ------- | -------- |
| `2xx` | Success | `200` - OK |
|       |         | `201` - Created |
|       |         | `204` - No content (silent OK) |
| `3xx` | Redirection | `301` - Moved (path changed)
| `4xx` | Client error | `400` - Bad request |
|       |         | `401` - Unauthorized |
|       |         | `403` - Not Permitted |
|       |         | `404` - Not Found |
| `5xx` | Server error | `500` - Internal server error |
|       |         | `502` - Bad gateway |
|       |         | `504` - Gateway timeout |

## Request-Response pattern

### Overview
- Represents how computers communicate over a network.
- API serves as the interface indicating the expected response for specific calls to a server.

![Request Response Pattern](https://github.com/styleDevNerd/Postman-API-Fundamentals-Student-Expert-Certification/blob/main/assests/request_response_pattern.png)

### Process

1. Client Makes Request:
    - Agent initiating the request, could be a browser or a custom-coded application.
    - Example: Postman acts as the client in sending requests.
2. Request Sent to Server:
    - Request is transmitted over the network to a designated server.
    - Example: Making a request over the public internet to a server like `https://library-api.postmanlabs.com`.
3. Server Processes Request:
    - Server interprets the request (e.g., HTTP GET /books) received from the client.
    - Example: The server understands the request and proceeds to process it.
4. Server Sends Response:
    - After processing, the server sends back an appropriate response over the network.
    - Example: Postman client receives a response from the server, such as a list of books.

### Example Scenario

- HTTP GET request made to `h`ttps://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books`.
- Server responds with a list of books.

### Conclusion 

- Request-response pattern facilitates communication between clients and servers over a network.
- Understanding this pattern is crucial for designing and developing applications that interact with backend services.
