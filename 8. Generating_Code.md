# Generating Code

## Overview

Postman can help you integrate API calls into your applications by generating code snippets in various coding languages.

## Generating Code Snippets

- Every request you made has a code generation tab you can access from the code `</>` icon in the far right.

- Once the code snippet generator pane is open, you can select from a dropdown to generate the API request in common coding languages like Python, JavaScript, C, NodeJS and more.

- For example, we can generate the `GET /books` request in `cURL` syntax:

- If we copy this snippet into the terminal and press Enter, we make the API call and the response body is printed:
