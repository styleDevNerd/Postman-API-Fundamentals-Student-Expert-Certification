# What is API ?

An Application Programming Interface (API) is a contract that allows code to talk to other code. APIs are the building blocks of modern software because they allow for sharing of resources and services across applications, organizations, and devices.

Eg: Listened to Spotify on both your desktop and your phone

## Why is API important ?

1. APIs help developers integrate exciting features and build automation without reinventing the wheel
ex: using a Weather API instead of launching your weather balloons
2. APIs allow enterprises to open up their product for faster innovation
ex: apps that interact with Twitter or Meta APIs by posting on your behalf or reading tweets
3. APIs can be products themselves
ex: Software as a Service (SaaS) products like Stripe's payment APIs or Twilio's text messaging and email APIs

## APIs - A Digital Restaurant

You can think of APIs as being like a waiter at a restaurant, serving as a go-between for the customer and the kitchen.

| Networking term | Description | Restaurant analogy |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| Client | The requester. Ex: browser, web app, mobile app | Customer |
| API | Simplified interface for interacting with the backend | Waiter |
| Server | The backend where the processing happens | Kitchen |

## Types of APIs

### The below types are in respect of Medium

1. **Hardware APIs** - Interface for software to talk to hardware.
`Example: How your phone's camera talks to the operating system.`
2. **Software Library APIs** - Interface for directly consuming code from another code base.
`Example: Using methods from a library you import into your application.`
3. **Web APIs** - Interface for communicating across code bases over a network.
`Example: Fetching current stock prices from a finance API over the internet.`

`Note: Multiple API types may be used to achieve a task`

### The below types are in respect of Architectures

1. REST (Representational State Transfer) `
    - Widely adopted API architecture.
    - Characteristics include not storing session state between requests, caching capabilities, and support for various data types.
2. GraphQL
    - A query language for APIs.
    - Provides a more flexible and efficient approach to data querying.
3. WebSockets
    - Enables bidirectional communication between client and server.
    - Suitable for real-time applications.
4. Webhooks
    - Mechanism for automatically notifying other systems when certain events occur.
    - Enables integration between different systems in a decoupled manner.
5. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
    - Protocol for exchanging structured information.
    - Used for communication between applications over a network.
6. gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)
    - High-performance RPC framework.
    - Facilitates communication between distributed systems.
7. MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport)
    - Lightweight messaging protocol for small sensors and mobile devices.
    - Suitable for IoT applications.

### The below types are in respect of Access

1. **Public APIs (aka Open APIs)** - Consumed by anyone who discovers the API
2. **Private APIs** - Consumed only within an organization and not made public
3. **Partner APIs** - Consumed between one or more organizations that have an established relationship
