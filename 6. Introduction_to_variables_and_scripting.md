# Introduction to variables and scripting

## Variables in Postman (continued)

### Introduction

- Variables in Postman are used to store values for reuse and to hide sensitive information like API keys.
- They help in keeping work DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) and secure.

### Variable Scope

- Postman allows setting variables at various scopes: global, collection, environment, data, and local.
- Variables are resolved based on the nearest and narrowest scope.
- If a variable is declared in multiple scopes, the value from the narrowest scope takes precedence.
    - Example: If both global and local variables with the same name exist, the local variable's value will be used during request execution.

### Collection Variables

- Collection variables reside at the collection level and are accessible anywhere within the collection.
- They provide a convenient way to share values across requests within the same collection.

## Setting variables programmatically

### Introduction to Scripting in Postman

- Postman allows adding automation and dynamic behaviors to collections with scripting.
- Scripts are executed during two events: before a request is sent (pre-request script) and after a response comes back (test script).

### Using the pm Object

- Postman provides a helper object named `pm` to access data about the environment, requests, responses, variables, and testing utilities.
- Example: Accessing the JSON response body from an API: `pm.response.json()`.
- Example: Getting collection variables like the value of `baseUrl`: `pm.collectionVariables.get("baseUrl")`.
- Example: Setting collection variables programmatically: `pm.collectionVariables.set("variableName", "variableValue")`.

## Task : Your first script

### Logging Data

- Use `console.log()` to print data/values to the console.
    - Example: `console.log("Hello world!")` will print "Hello world!" to the console.

### Comments

- Comments in JavaScript are skipped by the interpreter and are used for explanations.
- Single-line comments start with two slashes (`//`).
    - Example: `// This is a single-line comment`
- Multi-line comments are enclosed between `/*` and `*/`.
    - Example:
    ```
    /* 
    This is a multi-line comment.
    It can span multiple lines.
    */
    ```

### Adding a Script to a Request

- Modify the data in the request Body to include new book information.
- Open the Tests tab of the request.
- Inside the Tests editor, use JavaScript code to log the JSON response from the API:

```JSON
console.log(pm.response.json())
```

### Saving and Running the Request

- Save the request.
- Send the request, which triggers the script in the Tests tab to run after receiving the response from the API.

### Viewing Response Data

- Open the Postman Console located in the lower-left corner of the window.
- Scroll to the bottom of the logs to find the most recent request.
- The response data from the API is logged in the console due to the code in the Tests tab.

## Task : Grab the new book id

### Setting and Getting Collection Variables

- `pm.collectionVariables.set("variableName", value)`: Use this method to set a collection variable with a given name and value.
- `pm.collectionVariables.get("variableName")`: Use this method to retrieve the value of a collection variable by specifying its name.

### Local Variables in JavaScript

- `const`: Used for variables whose values won't change.
- `let`: Allows reassigning the value of a variable.

**Example:**

```JSON
// Defining variables with const
const myVar = "This variable can't be reassigned";
console.log(myVar); // Output: This variable can't be reassigned

// Attempting to reassign the value of myVar
myVar = "foo"; 
// Output: [ERROR!] Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

// Defining variables with let
let myVar2 = "I can change!";
console.log(myVar2); // Output: I can change!

myVar2 = "See, I changed!";
console.log(myVar2); // Output: See, I changed!
```

### Set the New Book ID as a Variable

- In the Body tab of the "add a book" request, update the book details to add a new book.
- In the Tests tab of the "add a book" request, replace the console.log() statement with the provided code snippet to save the value of the "id" from the API JSON response as a collection variable named "id".

**Example:**

```JSON
// Save the value of the "id" from the API JSON response to a const variable named "id"
const id = pm.response.json().id;

// Set the value of the "id" variable to a collection variable named "id"
pm.collectionVariables.set("id", id);
```

- Note: If there is no existing collection variable named "id," Postman will create a new variable named "id" and assign the value accordingly.

### Viewing Collection Variables

- After sending the request, view the collection variables by clicking on the Postman Library API v2 collection and then selecting the Variables tab.
- The variable "id" will be automatically assigned the id of the new book as its current value, ready to be used in subsequent requests.

### Usage

- Use `{{id}}` anywhere in the collection to access the value of the new book id, facilitating further requests.
