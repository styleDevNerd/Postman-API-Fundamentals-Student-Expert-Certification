# Request Parameters

## Variables in Postman

Postman allows you to save values as variables to reuse them and easily hide sensitive information like API Keys. 

We will use a variable to replace our base URL so that we don't have to type that repeatedly. Once a variable is defined, you can access its value using double curly brace syntax like this: `{{variableName}}`

## Steps to follow

1. Go to the "get books" request in your collection.
2. With your cursor, select the entire base URL of the API (https://library-api.postmanlabs.com). Do not include the slash / after .com.
    - Click "Set as variable" to save the base URL to a variable.
3. Click "Set as a new variable".
4. Name your new variable "baseUrl" and select "Collection" as the scope, then click Set variable.
5. Now that the variable is set, you can access the value anywhere in your collection by typing {{baseUrl}}

Hover over {{baseUrl}}. You will see its current value is set to https://library-api.postmanlabs.com

Please save and send the request; it will work exactly like before! You should get a status 200 OK response with a list of books.
