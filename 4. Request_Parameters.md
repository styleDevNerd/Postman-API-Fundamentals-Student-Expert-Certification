# Request Parameters

## Variables in Postman

Postman allows you to save values as variables to reuse them and easily hide sensitive information like API Keys. 

We will use a variable to replace our base URL so that we don't have to type that repeatedly. Once a variable is defined, you can access its value using double curly brace syntax like this: `{{variableName}}`

### Setting the "baseUrl" Variable

1. Go to the "get books" request in your collection.
2. With your cursor, select the entire base URL of the API (https://library-api.postmanlabs.com). Do not include the slash / after .com.
    - Click "Set as variable" to save the base URL to a variable.

3. Click "Set as a new variable".

![Set as new variable](https://github.com/styleDevNerd/Postman-API-Fundamentals-Student-Expert-Certification/blob/main/assests/set_as_new_variable.png)

4. Name your new variable "baseUrl" and select "Collection" as the scope, then click Set variable.

5. Now that the variable is set, you can access the value anywhere in your collection by typing {{baseUrl}}

### Viewing and Managing Variables

- Hover over {{baseUrl}} to see its current value set to https://library-api.postmanlabs.com.
- To find Collection variables:
    - Click on your collection, then the Variables tab.
    - Here you can view and edit your variables.

**Note:**
- Collection variables have two columns:
    - **Initial Value:** the value initially set when someone forks or imports your collection. It's visible to others if you share your collection.
    - **Current Value:** Postman resolves the variable to this value, local to your Postman account. It's recommended to keep secrets like API Keys ONLY in this column and not include them in the Initial Value column.

## Query Parameters

### Overview

- Query parameters are key-value pairs added to the end of the URL to refine a request.
- They provide additional information to the server for processing the request.

### Syntax

- Query parameters start with a question mark (?), followed by key-value pairs: `<key>=<value>`.
- Multiple query parameters are separated by an ampersand (&).

### Example

- Fetching photos with a specific orientation:
    - `GET https://some-api.com/photos?orientation=landscape`
- Fetching photos with specific orientation and size:
    - `GET https://some-api.com/photos?orientation=landscape&size=500x400`

### Usage

- Query parameters are used to filter, sort, or customize responses from APIs.
- They can be optional or required depending on the API's implementation.
- Always refer to the API documentation to understand the usage and requirements of query parameters.

### Example: Google Search

- Searching on Google with query parameters:
    - Example URL: `https://www.google.com/search?q=postman`
    - Here, `q=postman` specifies the search term "postman".

## Task : Search books by genre

### Filter for Fiction Books

### Steps

1. **Duplicate Request:**
    - Hover over the "get books" request in the Postman Library API v2 Collection.
    - Click the three dots icon and select "Duplicate" to create a copy.
    - Rename the duplicated request to "get fiction books." You can edit the collection name in the right pane.
2. **Add Query Parameter:**
    - In the duplicated request, navigate to the Params tab.
    - Add a query parameter with key "genre" and value "fiction" to filter for fiction books.
    - Postman automatically syncs the request URL, adding the "?" to indicate the start of query parameters.
3. **Save and Send Request:**
    - Save the modified request.
    - Send the request.
4. **Verify Response:**
    - Upon sending the request, expect a 200 OK response.
    - The response will contain an array of book objects, but only those with the fiction genre.

![Search by Genre](https://github.com/styleDevNerd/Postman-API-Fundamentals-Student-Expert-Certification/blob/main/assests/search_genre.gif)

### Additional Options

- You can experiment with different values for the "genre" query parameter to filter for other genres.
- Remember to save your request after making any modifications.

## Task : Multiple query parameters

### Objective

As a librarian, assisting visitors in finding available books (not checked out).

### Steps

1. Add Another Query Parameter:
    - Modify the GET request to `/books` to include a second query parameter.
    - Ensure that the parameter `checkedOut` is set to `false`.
    - This addition filters the response to only include books that are not checked out.
2. Request Execution:
    - Save the modified request.
    - Send the request to the server.

![Multiple query parameter](https://github.com/styleDevNerd/Postman-API-Fundamentals-Student-Expert-Certification/blob/main/assests/multiple_query_parameter.png)

### Expected Outcome

Upon sending the request:
    - Expect a 200 OK response from the server.
    - The response should contain an array of fiction books that are not checked out.
    - If there are no fiction books available, the response should return an empty array ([]).

## Path Variable

### Definition

Path variable (or path parameter) is a dynamic section of a URL path, often used for IDs and entity names.

### Syntax

- Path variables come immediately after a slash in the URL path.
- Example: `GET https://api.github.com/users/{username}`

### Usage

- Allows passing dynamic values in the URL path.
- Can have multiple path variables in a single request.
- Example: `GET https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repoName}`

### Comparison with Query Parameters

| Path Variable | Query Variable |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| ex: `/books/abc123` | ex: `/books?search=borges&checkedOut=false` |
| Located directly after a slash in the path. It can be anywhere on the path | Located only at the end of a path, right after a question mark `?` |
| Accepts dynamic values | Accepts defined query keys with potentially dynamic values. |
| * Often used for IDs or entity names | * Often used for options and filters |

- **Note:** These are conventions; some APIs might use query parameters for IDs or usernames.

### When to Use Path Variables

- Always refer to API documentation to determine if path parameters are required.
- Some APIs use colon syntax (e.g., `/users/:username`), while others use curly braces (e.g., `/users/{username}`). Both denote dynamic parts of the path.

## Task : Get a book by id

### Overview

- To retrieve a specific book from the library's collection, we can use the GET method with the path `/books/:id`, where `:id` represents the unique identifier of the book.
- The unique identifier allows us to access the book's information even if other properties change.

### Steps

1. Create a new request in Postman:
    - Click on the three dots icon in the Postman Library API v2 Collection.
    - Select "Add request" and name it "Get book by id".
    - Set the request method to GET.
2. Set up the request URL:
    - Paste the endpoint `{{baseUrl}}/books/:id` as the request URL.
    - Postman automatically adds a "Path Variables" editor in the Params tab for path variables.
3. Provide the book's id as a path variable:
    - In the Params tab, paste the id for the book "Ficciones" (`29cd820f-82f9-4b45-a7f4-0924111b5b89`) as the value for the path variable named `id`.
    - Ensure there are no whitespaces around the id value.

4. Save the request.
5. Send the request:
    - Click on the "Send" button.
    - Expect a 200 OK response with a single JSON object representing the "Ficciones" book, indicating it is not checked out.

### Debugging requests in Postman Console

- The Postman Console, located in the lower left of Postman, logs all requests and responses.
- Check the console for any errors or unexpected behavior.
- Ensure the raw request is sent as expected, especially with query and path parameter values.
- Postman replaces the `:id` placeholder with the actual book id when making the request.
