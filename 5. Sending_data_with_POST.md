# Sending data with POST

## Task : Add a book

### Objective

As a librarian, adding a new book to the library involves making a POST request with a JSON body to submit book data to the Postman Library API database.

### Understanding the Body

The body data contains structured information that needs to be sent with requests, particularly with PUT, POST, and PATCH requests. It can include various data formats such as JSON, text, JavaScript, HTML, or XML.

### Making a POST Request

1. Create a New Request:
    - Hover over the Postman Library API v2 Collection.
    - Click the three dots icon and select "Add request."
    - Name the new request "add book."
2. Set Request Method and URL:
    - Set the request method to POST.
    - Set the request URL to {{baseUrl}}/books.
3. Add Body Data:
    - Click on the "Body" tab.
    - Select "raw" as the data type and then choose JSON.
    - Inside the Body editor, add a JSON object with details about the new book's title, author, genre, and yearPublished.

Example JSON Object:
```JSON
{
  "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird",
  "author": "Harper Lee",
  "genre": "fiction",
  "yearPublished": 1960
}
```

## Task : Add an authorization header

### Authorization

- APIs may require authorization for certain endpoints to control access.
- Open endpoints could lead to unauthorized access or overload from bots.

**Methods for Authorization**

- Basic Auth: Username and password.
- OAuth: Delegated authorization.
- API Keys: Secret strings registered to a developer.

### Getting an API Key

- APIs using API Key auth often provide keys via a developer portal.
- Keys track usage and identify callers.
- Example: Postman Library API v2:
    - Header name: api-key
    - Header value: postmanrulz
    - Required for requests altering database data.

### Headers

- Headers convey metadata like authorization or desired response data type.
- Analogous to envelope details when sending a letter.
- Separate from request payload (e.g., new book information).

### Adding API Key to Request Header

- Navigate to the "add a book" request and select the Headers tab.
- Add the key "api-key" with a value of "postmanrulz" in the Headers helper table.
- Save and send the request.

- Upon success, expect a 201 Created response with additional book details.

### Success Confirmation

- Upon successful authorization, a 201 Created response is expected.
- Newly added book will have a unique ID, checkout status, and creation timestamp.

### View New Book (Optional)

- Use the received book ID to fetch its details.
- Update the "get books by id" request with the new ID value.

### Conclusion

- Proper authorization ensures secure access to API endpoints.
- Postman provides an intuitive interface for managing headers and authorization.

## Task : Use Postman Auth instead!

### Delete the api-key header

- Remove the hard-coded api-key header from the "add a book" request.
- Hover over the api-key header in the Headers tab and click the "x" icon to delete it.
- Save the request.

### Add Auth to the Collection

- Navigate to the collection "Postman Library API v2" and select the Authorization (or Auth) tab.
- Choose API Key as the auth Type.
- Enter the API Key details: Key: api-key, Value: postmanrulz, Add to: Header.
- Save the changes to the collection.

### Add a new book

- Modify the body of the "add a book" request in the Body tab to add another book.
- Ensure the Auth method in the Authorization tab of the request is set to "Inherit from parent" to utilize the API Key set at the collection level.
- Save the request and send it.

### Postman Console

- Open the Postman Console in the lower left to verify that the API Key has been added as a header (api-key: postmanrulz), indicating authorization.

By following these steps, the API Key authentication is implemented using Postman Auth, ensuring authorized access for requests within the collection.
