# PATCH and DELETE

## Task : Checkout your book

### Objective 

As a librarian, you will update the library database via the API to mark the book's checkedOut status from false to true.

### Steps

1. Hover on your Postman Library API v2 collection, click the three dots, and select Add request. Name your new request "checkout a book"
2. Set the request method to PATCH
3. Set the request URL to `{{baseUrl}}/books/:id`
4. Set the value of the path variable `id` to `{{id}}`.
    - This will use the value of our collection variable named id that was set in the Test script of the"add a book" request. You can see the value by hovering on your id variable.

## Task : Delete your book

### Objective

he person that checked out your book accidentally lost it... you will need to delete it from the library database.

### Steps

1. Hover on your Postman Library API v2 collection, click the three dots, and select "Add request", name your new request "delete a book"
2. Set the request method of the "delete a book" request to `DELETE`
3. Set the request URL to `{{baseUrl}}/books/:id`
4. In the Params tab of the request, make sure the path variable id is set to `{{id}}`
5. Save and Send your request.

**Note:** You should get a `204 No Content` response from the API. This means the server successfully deleted the book, and won't send any response body back.

### Check if its really gone!

- Without changing anything, try sending your request again.
- Since you are sending a request to delete a book with an id that no longer exists, you get a `404` error!
